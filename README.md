# SFDownloadFiles

SFDownloadFiles is an Excel Utility to download multiple files of all types from salesforce into a structured directory.

This utility was created to use a report of objects (Usually Cases) to download all files related to those objects into a structured directory with a folder for each object's files.

It works just as well if you just have a list of Content Document Links, or if you want, to download all files into the same directory.

For installation, configuration, and using this utility, see [SFDownloadFiles](https://github.com/jdpond/SFConversionsForExcel/wiki/SFDownloadFiles-User-Guide)
